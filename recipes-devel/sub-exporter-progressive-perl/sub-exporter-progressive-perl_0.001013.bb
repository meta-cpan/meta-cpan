DESCRIPTION = "Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes \
great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is \
a "Sub::Exporter" wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all \
they are doing is picking exports, but use "Sub::Exporter" if your users \
try to use "Sub::Exporter"'s more advanced features, like renaming exports, \
if they try to use them."
