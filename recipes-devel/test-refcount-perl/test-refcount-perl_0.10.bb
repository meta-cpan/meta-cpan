DESCRIPTION = "The Perl garbage collector uses simple reference counting during the normal \
execution of a program. This means that cycles or unweakened references in \
other parts of code can keep an object around for longer than intended. To \
help avoid this problem, the reference count of a new object from its class \
constructor ought to be 1. This way, the caller can know the object will be \
properly DESTROYed when it drops all of its references to it."
