DESCRIPTION = "Hash::Merge merges two arbitrarily deep hashes into a single hash. That is, \
at any level, it will add non-conflicting key-value pairs from one hash to \
the other, and follows a set of specific rules when there are key value \
conflicts (as outlined below). The hash is followed recursively, so that \
deeply nested hashes that are at the same level will be merged when the \
parent hashes are merged. Please note that self-referencing hashes, or \
recursive references, are not handled well by this method."
