DESCRIPTION = "This module provides a number of list utility functions, all of which take \
an initial code block to control their behaviour. They are variations on \
similar core perl or "List::Util" functions of similar names, but which use \
the block to control their behaviour. For example, the core Perl function \
"sort" takes a list of values and returns them, sorted into order by their \
string value. The "sort_by" function sorts them according to the string \
value returned by the extra function, when given each value."
