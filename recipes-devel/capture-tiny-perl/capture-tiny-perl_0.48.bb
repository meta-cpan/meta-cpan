DESCRIPTION = "Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture almost anything \
sent to STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl, from XS \
code or from an external program. Optionally, output can be teed so that it \
is captured while being passed through to the original filehandles. Yes, it \
even works on Windows (usually). Stop guessing which of a dozen capturing \
modules to use in any particular situation and just use this one."
