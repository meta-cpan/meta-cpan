DESCRIPTION = "It is often a pain to write a server program that supports graceful \
restarts, with no resource leaks. Server::Starter solves the problem by \
splitting the task into two. One is start_server, a script provided as a \
part of the module, which works as a superdaemon that binds to zero or more \
TCP ports or unix sockets, and repeatedly spawns the server program that \
actually handles the necessary tasks (for example, responding to incoming \
connections). The spawned server programs under Server::Starter call \
accept(2) and handle the requests."
