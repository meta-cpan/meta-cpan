DESCRIPTION = "File::pushd does a temporary "chdir" that is easily and automatically \
reverted, similar to "pushd" in some Unix command shells. It works by \
creating an object that caches the original working directory. When the \
object is destroyed, the destructor calls "chdir" to revert to the original \
working directory. By storing the object in a lexical variable with a \
limited scope, this happens automatically at the end of the scope."
