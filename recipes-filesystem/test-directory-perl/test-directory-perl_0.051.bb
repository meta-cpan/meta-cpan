DESCRIPTION = "Testing code can involve making sure that files are created and deleted as \
expected. Doing this manually can be error prone, as it's easy to forget a \
file, or miss that some unexpected file was added. This module simplifies \
maintaining test directories by tracking their status as they are modified \
or tested with this API, making it simple to test both individual files, as \
well as to verify that there are no missing or unknown files."
