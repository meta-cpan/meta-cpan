DESCRIPTION = "In the daemontools way of thinking, a daemon writes all its logging output \
to STDOUT (or STDERR), which is a pipe to a logger process. Doing this \
instead of other logging alternatives keeps your program simple and allows \
you to capture errors generated by deeper libraries (like libc) which \
aren't aware of your logging API. If you want complicated logging you \
can keep those details in the logging process and not bloat each daemon \
you write. \
 \
This module aims to be the easiest, simplest, most efficent way to get \
Log::Any messages to a file handle while still being flexible enough for \
the needs of the typical unix daemon or utility script."
